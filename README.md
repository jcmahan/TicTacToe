# TicTacToe
my initial attempt at TTT game

What I'm trying to do: 
start off by creating a game object holding "playerOne" "PlayerTwo" "currentPlayer" and a "move" counter. 

I'm failing at the "setCurrentPlayer" function... I figured I'd try to use a modulus of the "turn" counter to define if 
playerOne or playerTwo would be the currentPlayer. This is failing. 

I've been stuck on this, so I'm not able to get much past this. 

Any breadcrumbs you might give me would be truly appreciated. I've been beating my head against the wall for a few hours now, and Googling 
isn't delivering much help at all. 

thanks! hope you had a happy St. Patrick's Day!
